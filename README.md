NCS-Object-Script-Fiddle
========================

Just a crude concept for a "fiddle" site like Codepen.io and jsfiddle.net but for NEWSCYCLE Digital code

## Live Example 

You can see a live example of this here: 
http://swdev.tc1.dc.publicus.com/section/objectscript_fiddle

## Usage 

Right now you can only use NEWSCYCLE Digital's Object Script in it. For example, you can display the current date like so:

<%currentdate%>
